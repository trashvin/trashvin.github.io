Finally, I'm moving to this blog site after decades at blogspot. I don't have any issues with blogspot, however, I think the time to update to a new platform is now. Besides, using GitHub as my hosting site and Markdown as the main editing format is my best option right now. Between now and my last post on my [old blog](https://trashvin.blogspot.com), there has been a lot of changes. I have been wanting to restart by blogging along side with possible vlogging this year, I just dont have the time and topic to start with. The holidays and my previous trainings and experiences is an expected catalyst. So let me begin, again.

# What's New

For more that a decade now, my work has never changed. However, recent changes ad opportunities ignited excitement. No new projects, but possible learnings and future development are coming.
