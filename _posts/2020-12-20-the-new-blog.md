![new blog](https://i.imgur.com/7mAMqgG.jpg)

Finally, I'm moving to this new blog after decades at blogspot. I don't have any issues with blogspot, however, I think the time to update to a new platform is now and Jekyll seems to fit my requirements. Besides, using GitHub as my hosting site and Markdown as the main editing format is my best option right now. Between now and my last post on my [old blog](https://trashvin.blogspot.com), there has been a lot of changes. I have been wanting to restart my blogging and possible vlogging this year, I just don't have the time and topic to start with. The holidays and my previous trainings and experiences are an expected catalyst. So let me begin, again.

## What's New

For more than a decade now, my work has never changed. However, recent changes and opportunities ignited excitement. No new projects, but possible learnings and future development are coming. Along with that, new knowledge to share!
