Last December, I was asked to give a short talk infront of fresh graduates and career shifters. My topic, the basic skills a developer must poses to get started in the industry. I ended up referencing the anatomy of a human being.

When I was about to graduate from college or even when I tried moving to another workplace, I always have doubts on whether my skills measure up. Experience would tell me that there are basic skills any developer on any level must possess to survive the competition. In this blog post, I will map these skills to a generic anatomy of a human.

## Problem Solving Skills

Software developers are destined to provide solutions to problems by developing an program or application a common layman can use. So for them to do that, they must first understand how a human solves a problem then later translate this solution into a computer can execute. That is why we should consider the problem solving skill as the brain for a developer. 

But what are these problems? Below are some example scenarios where these can be encountered:

- A client asking you for a fix to an error or bug in their application.
- A client asking you to add features in their existing application.
- A client asking you to create a new application for their new process.
- Your manager asking you to automate an existing manual office workflow
- The internet depriving you of access to Google or StackOverflow :)

So you see, not all problems are errors or bugs. But all of the require solutions. To illustrate my point as to why problem solving skill is the most important skill a developer must possess, lets look at these two different stories in the workplace.

### Story 1 : Tale of Two Problems

On a beautiful day, a developer maybe faced with simple problem with , most often times, a straight forward solution. If you are lucky, the solution can implemented with just few lines of code. If you woke up in the wrong side of the bed, you maybe looking at a simple yet task intensive work. Maybe the implementation requires large amount of code or data gathering will take time. Regardless, what you really need is just sheer amount of hard work.

On another type of day you may face a rather tricky problem or perhaps a problem with unexpected complications. A problem with problems, so to speak.
