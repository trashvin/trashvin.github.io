Last year, I was asked to give a short talk infront of fresh graduates and career shifters. My topic, the basic skills a developer must poses to get started in the industry. I ended up referencing the anatomy of a human being.

When I was about to graduate from college or even when I tried moving to another workplace, I always have doubts on whether my skills measure up. Experience would tell me that there are basic skills any developer on any level must possess to survive the competition. In this blog post, I will map these skills to a generic anatomy of a human.

## Problem Solving Skills
![problem solving skills](https://i.imgur.com/Z0kRj9z.png)

Software developers are destined to provide solutions to problems by developing an program or application a common layman can use. So for them to do that, they must first understand how a human solves a problem then later translate this solution into a computer can execute. That is why we should consider the problem solving skill as the brain for a developer. 

But what are these problems? Below are some example scenarios where these can be encountered:

- A client asking you for a fix to an error or bug in their application.
- A client asking you to add features in their existing application.
- A client asking you to create a new application for their new process.
- Your manager asking you to automate an existing manual office workflow
- The internet depriving you of access to Google or StackOverflow :)

So you see, not all problems are errors or bugs. But all of the require solutions. To illustrate my point as to why problem solving skill is the most important skill a developer must possess, lets look at these two different stories in the workplace.

### Story 1 : Tale of Two Problems

On a beautiful day, a developer maybe faced with simple problem with , most often times, a straight forward solution. If you are lucky, the solution can implemented with just few lines of code. If you woke up in the wrong side of the bed, you maybe looking at a simple yet task intensive work. Maybe the implementation requires large amount of code or data gathering will take time. Regardless, what you really need is just sheer amount of hard work.

On another type of day you may face a rather tricky problem or perhaps a problem with unexpected complications. A problem with problems, so to speak. For this, you need more than hard work. Your problem solving skill will be very valuable. Such skills will require:

- Analytical Thinking
- Logical Thinking
- Creative Thinking
- Resourcefulness

To illustrate some of my points, a month ago we were tasked to solve a production problem. This are errors that occur in the actual environment where the application is used. Unfortunately, the device simulators that we have can recreate the scenario. For us to solve the issue we need to design and create a "hack" so that our simulators can produce our needed result. With this were able to solve our simulator issue and eventually solve the main problem that the customer reported.

### Story 2 : The Big Problem

As I have mentioned a while back, problems need not to be errors. When you are task to create an application, that is a problem for you. In some cases the application may require large scale development, too many requirements or too many dependencies. As a software developer, you should have the skill to breakdown a big problem to smaller "chunks". We go with the "divide and conquer" technique. We can break down a problem into two or more sub-problems until these become simple enough to be solved directly.

### Tips

- If you can’t explain something in simple terms, you don’t understand it. (understanding is the key)
- The biggest mistake new developers make is focusing on learning syntax instead of learning how to solve problems. If you don’t know the solution how can you create a program to solve it.
- Demonstrating problem solving is just as valuable (if not more so)  than the baseline technical skills required for a job.

Now we proceed to the next skill, transforming your solution to something the computer can understand.

## Coding or Programming Skills

The ability to learn programming concepts and apply them to solve problems is an essential skill for a software developer.  Take note of the term "programming concepts" and not "programming language or syntax". Since this skill gives us the ability to start realizing solutions to problems, we can refer to it as one of the hands or arms of a developer.

What are these concepts?

Basic Constructs. Being knowledgable to the basic constructs almost common to all general purpose programming language is essential. As a developer, one must be
